# Hi! 

### UW Madison Courses for CS and DS Degrees (Some of Them)
###### CS 300 (OOP Programming in Java - Hobbes Legault)
This class was a nice introduction to programing and my professor was really great. I didn't feel like I was prepared enough from my high school experience to complete the first few projects,
but I felt much more competent after this class.

###### CS/ECE 252 (Introduction to Computer Engineering - Karu Sankaralingam)
This was such a cool class, and it was definitely one of my favorites. We started out learning about transistors, and slowly worked our way up to logic gates, then boolean algebra, until finally getting to assembly.  
I was just so amazed to learn about how computers actually work at the hardware level, and it was a perfectly paced progression from hardware to software.  
Honestly, this class made me wonder if I should have picked computer engineering. So glad I took this! :)

###### NutrSci 132 (Nutrition Today - Yirong Wang)
This was a class that was the perfect blend of covering the underlying science behind different nutrition subjects while also being generally applicable to daily life. 
I really appreciated the professor's focus on helping us live a healthy lifestyle by presenting lots of different approaches to eating healthy that weren't necessarily the typical approaches.

###### Math 340 (Linear Algebra - Dohyun Kim)
I took this class my first semester as a bright-eyed freshman that was very interested in machine learning/AI topics, and I was told that linear algebra is the basis for which modern ML is created.
I was a little shocked about the amount of proofs and the structure of the exams being very conceptual, but I'm glad I took the class since it's so fundamental.

###### CS 400 (OOP Programming in Java II - Florian Heimerl)
CS 300 had a medium-sized project every week, but in 400 it's moreso 3 group projects where you work on small parts each week. Honestly, I thought it was a lot less work, but it
was really difficult to understand what you were actually supposed to do. I thought the class was a little light conent-wise, but I did appreciate the introductions it gave us to VMs, the terminal, and html/css/js.

###### Stat 324 (Statistics for Engineers - Michael Culbertson)
This class covered a lot of the tests that are used to prove statistical significance through obtaining a p-value. It wasn't super relevant to the other classes I took, but the statistics knowledge helped with data science.

###### CS 240 (Discrete Mathematics - Beck Hasti)
Discrete mathematics was very different from most other mathematics. It's basically the math theory that's used in computing, so it was a lot of logic, "induction" proofs which help prove that programs do what they say they can.
The first half was a little theoretical/proof heavy for me, but I really enjoyed the second half which was a lot more "practical" and covered CS-related topics like graphs, counting (more about combinations than the skill that 4-year old, I promise).

###### CS 540 (Intro to Artificial Intelligence - Fred Sala)
I was so excited to take this class, but I was hoping to get a little more in-depth with a topic within AI. Instead, it was largely an overview of topics in the field of AI, but it was really cool to try things like deep learning and making a game opponent.
I'm still glad I took it, but I wish I had time to go more in-depth with the topics we covered.

###### CS 639 (Intro to Computer Vision - Mohit Gupta)
I felt lucky to take this class because it was a small class that was being piloted during my 3rd semester, and I was super excited to learn about computer vision.
Some of the projects were really cool -- we made a panorama application and an object tracking project that would track an object throughout a video.

###### Stat 240 (Data Modeling I - Bi Cheng Wu)
This was my first Data Science class, and I really enjoyed the visual aspect of graphing the data and making nice clean reports in markdown to showcase my results. 
It was a nice change of pace from the CS classes I had taken, and I ultimately found that the majors paired really well together.

###### CS 354 (Machine Organization and Programming - Debra Deppeler)
This class took me a bit off guard because it was a low-level programming class in C, which at the time was pretty difficult for me. I enjoyed learning about the low-level workings
of what computers do, and I have definitely used what I've learned from this class in all of my future classes. We covered assembly as well as C, and I became a lot better at
making and testing my projects out of necessity.

###### CS 577 (Introduction to Algorithms - Marc Renault)
This class is a little bit difficult, but it was a good introduction to making algorithms and more importantly proving their efficacy and efficiency. 
It was maybe a little too theoretical for me, but it is an important class that changed the way I make things.

###### Stat 340 (Data Modeling II - Brian Powers)
This class was decent, but there just wasn't that much information compared to prior data science classes.
We learned Monte Carlo estimation as another tool for our analysis toolkit, but there wasn't too much new content after Stat 240.

###### Art 112 (Drawing I - Michael Velliquette)
I took this class because I wanted to learn how to draw, and I learned a lot. It was a complete different change of pace from my Comp Sci classes to be creative and to explain and
present my work to my classmates. I was blown away by how skilled some of my classmates were at art, and I wish I had time for more of these classes.

###### Entom 201 (Insects and Human Culture)
This was a nice class where you learn about insects and their importance in the ecosystem, but it's also the class where you get to raise a caterpillar into a moth. It was fun to
see how rapidly it gained in size, and I learned a bit more about how insects can be both harmful and helpful in agriculture.

###### Stat 436 (Data Visualization - Kris Sankaran)
I liked this class because it built on a lot of the other data sciences classes that I'd had since we made a lot of visualizations, especially interactive ones, and we had the freedom
to create more complete and independent projects.

###### CS 537 (Intro to Operating Systems - Louis Oliphant)
This class was by far the most challenging class that I have taken. I would say I was spenidng about 20-30 hours per week on this class alone.
Luckily, the exams were very fair, but the projects were fairly involved and lengthy. I did learn a lot though, and I became a better programmer as a result.
I had an incredible project partner for this class that helped me learn a lot of the Git fundamentals like rebasing and just working in a team in general.

###### CS 544 (Big Data Systmes - Tyler Caraza-Harter)
This was a great class with a lot of relevant applications for industry in Big Data. It was a really nice class that covered Bash scripting, Docker, various new tools like
BigQuery, Kafka, PyArrow, and others! Really glad I took this.

###### CS 564 (Database Management Systems: Design and Implementation - Anhai Doan)
The first part of this class was about designing ER diagrams and using databases (with SQL queries), and the second half was more on the innerworkings of databases such as keeping ACID
principles intact and actually implementing database functions using C++.

###### CS 320 (Data Science Programming II - Gurmail Singh)
This class was pretty simple for me since I probably took it too late in my degree programs, but I think it could have been a useful class to get acquainted with Git, Python, OOP, 
trees, web scraping, regex, and data visualization/analysis with some simple ML methods.


###### CS 571 (UI With React - Cole Nelson)
I'm so glad I took this class because it was wonderfully taught, relevant, and I learned a lot. This was one of my favorite classes because it was very different 
from a lot of my other classes in that everything was very visual, and I would end each project with a resentable finished product. 
It was so satisfying to see the changes visually show up on my site every time I saved my code.
