# Hi! 

### UW Madison Courses for CS and DS Degrees (Most of Them)
###### CS 300 (OOP Programming in Java - Hobbes Legault)
This class was a nice introduction to programing and my professor was really great. I didn't feel like I was prepared enough from my high school experience to complete the first few projects,
but I felt much more competent after this class.

###### CS/ECE 252 (Introduction to Computer Engineering - Karu Sankaralingam)
This was such a cool class, and it was definitely one of my favorites. We started out learning about transistors, and slowly worked our way up to logic gates, then boolean algebra, until finally getting to assembly.  
I was just so amazed to learn about how computers actually work at the hardware level, and it was a perfectly paced progression from hardware to software.  
Honestly, this class made me wonder if I should have picked computer engineering. So glad I took this! :)

###### NutrSci 132 (Nutrition Today - Yirong Wang)


###### Math 340


###### LIS 201


###### CS 400


###### Stat 324
###### Geog 305
###### CS 240
###### CS 540
###### CS 639 (Intro to Computer Vision - Mohit Gupta)
I felt lucky to take this class because it was a small class that was being piloted during my 3rd semester, and I was super excited to learn about computer vision.
Some of the projects were really cool -- we made a panorama application and an object tracking project that would track an object throughout a video.

###### Soc 134
###### Stat 240
This was my first Data Science class, and I really enjoyed the visual aspect of graphing the data and making nice clean reports in markdown to showcase my results. 

###### CS 354 
###### CS 577
###### Stat 340
###### Art 112
###### Entom 201
###### Stat 436
###### CS 537
###### CS 544
###### CS 564
###### CS 320
###### CS 571 (UI With React - Cole Nelson)
I'm so glad I took this class because it was wonderfully taught, relevant, and I learned a lot. This was one of my favorite classes because it was very different 
from a lot of my other classes in that I had a presentable finished product, and I could see the changes visually show up every time I saved my code.
